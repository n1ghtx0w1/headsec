\r\nThere is a lot of choice but opportunities may be limited. \r\nIf you aren’t sure what industry you'd like to work-in, then look at job boards and understand the requirements for getting into particular industries.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Some Resources\r\n\r\nBelow are some of the resources that I've used.\r\n\r\n### Educational\r\n\r\nUnderstand your industry and what the requirements are proir to paying for anything.\r\n\r\n- [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) *`I only bought courses when they were $11 USD`*\r\n\r\n- [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/)\r\n\r\n- [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/)\r\n\r\n- [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/)\r\n\r\n- [Western Governors University](https://www.wgu.edu/) \r\n\r\nIf you decide to enroll to [WGU](https://www.wgu.edu/)then you can find my referral here --[WGU Referral](https://infl.tv/o67J). \r\n\r\n\r\nYou get subscriptions to [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/), [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/), and [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/) as a [WGU](https://www.wgu.edu/) student.\r\nI'd caution that you really should be a 'self-starter' and very responsible to attend [Western Governors University](https://www.wgu.edu/).\r\n\r\nDo your research before joining any platform, or University!\r\nI chose to pay for courses on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) prior to pursuing higher education. \r\nOnce I understood the material then I knew I was ready to work towards the degree and certifications.\r\nThis was a necessary path for me understanding the industries that I wanted to work in required a combination of certifications and the degree.\r\n\r\nI chose to attend [WGU](https://www.wgu.edu/) because it provided me with certifications and the degree.\r\nThings I required but you may not. \r\nYou don't need a degree or certifications necessarily to get into cyber.\r\n\r\n### Getting Hands On\r\n\r\nThe material in this section is great for mixing things up a bit. \r\nOnce upon a time I would watch youtube videos on hacking and mess with vulnhub.  \r\nThen it turned to me taking udemy classes.  \r\nI'd take a break from Udemy, and pivot over to Hackthebox or Tryhackme.\r\n\r\n- [TCM Security](https://tcm-sec.com/)\r\n\r\n- [Tryhackme](https://www.tryhackme.com/)\r\n\r\n- [HackTheBox - Academy](https://academy.hackthebox.com/) and my --[Referral](https://referral.hackthebox.com/mz9PNmZ)\r\n\r\n- [Terminus](https://web.mit.edu/mprat/Public/web/Terminus/Web/main.html)\r\n\r\n- [OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/)\r\n\r\n- [Vulnhub](https://www.vulnhub.com/)\r\n\r\n- [Blue Team Labs](https://blueteamlabs.online/)\r\n\r\n- [Immersive Labs](https://www.immersivelabs.com/)\r\n\r\n- [PWNED Labs](https://pwnedlabs.io/)\r\n\r\n### Make Learning Fun\r\n\r\nLearning can be fun when you find others to compete with in **\"Capture the Flag\"** **(CTF)** competitions. \r\nThis is something I do with fellow [WGU](https://www.wgu.edu/) students.\r\n\r\n- [picoCTF](https://picoctf.org/)\r\n\r\n- [CTFTIME](https://ctftime.org/)\r\n\r\n- [NCAE CYBER GAMES](https://www.ncaecybergames.org/)\r\n\r\n- [NATIONAL CYBER LEAGUE](https://nationalcyberleague.org/)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n> Cyber roles will likely require constant learning.

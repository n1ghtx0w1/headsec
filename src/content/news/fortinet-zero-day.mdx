## 🔍 Overview

A threat actor has reportedly advertised a zero-day exploit targeting Fortinet's FortiGate firewalls. 
The exploit allegedly allows remote code execution, unauthorized access, granting full control over vulnerable devices. 
This development aligns with Fortinet's recent advisory on threat actors maintaining persistent access to FortiOS and FortiProxy devices affected by known vulnerabilities.

## 🛠️ Vulnerability Summary

- **CVE ID:** Not assigned yet  
- **Affected Products:** Fortinet FortiGate Firewalls  
- **Attack Vector:** Remote (unauthenticated)  
- **Impact:** Full device compromise, extraction of configuration files, credentials, admin permissions, firewall policies, and two-factor authentication status  
- **Exploit Availability:** Advertised for sale on a dark web forum

## 🧩 Technical Details

The threat actor claims the exploit enables remote code execution without authentication, providing full control over the targeted FortiGate devices.
This includes the ability to extract sensitive configuration files and information such as credentials and security policies.
The exploit's advertisement surfaced as Fortinet released an advisory about attackers maintaining persistent access to devices by exploiting known vulnerabilities, specifically CVE-2022-42475, CVE-2023-27997, and CVE-2024-21762.
Attackers have been creating symbolic links between user and root filesystems to evade detection and maintain access even after patches are applied.

## 🧱 Mitigation Guidance

Fortinet recommends the following actions to mitigate risks associated with the exploitation of known vulnerabilities:

- Update FortiOS to versions 7.6.2, 7.4.7, 7.2.11, 7.0.17, or 6.4.16, which include fixes for the symbolic link issue.
- Apply the latest AV/IPS signatures provided by Fortinet.
- Audit SSL-VPN configurations and monitor for unauthorized symbolic links or unusual access patterns.
- Implement strict access controls and monitor administrative account activities.

As the alleged zero-day exploit has not been officially confirmed or assigned a CVE ID, organizations should remain vigilant and monitor Fortinet's advisories for updates.

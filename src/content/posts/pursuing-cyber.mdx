So, you're interested in cyber security...

## Where to Start?

```bash
user@my-linux-distro:~#  whoami
beginner 
```

Find what industry you're interested working in and start learning! 
Opportunities may be limited depending on what it is that you want to do. 
There are many different cyber security paths you can traverse. 
If you arenâ€™t sure yet, then look at job boards and develop an understanding of the requirements for getting into particular industries.

## Resources

Below are online resources that I've used.

### Educational

> Do your own research before paying for anything!!!

- [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) *`I only bought courses when they were $11 USD`*

- [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/)

- [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/)

- [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/)

- [Western Governors University](https://www.wgu.edu/) 

If you decide to enroll to [WGU](https://www.wgu.edu/)then you can find my referral here --[WGU Referral](https://infl.tv/o67J). 

You get subscriptions to [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/), [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/), and [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/) as a [WGU](https://www.wgu.edu/) student.
I'd caution that you really should be a 'self-starter' and very responsible to attend [Western Governors University](https://www.wgu.edu/).

Do your research before joining any platform, or University!
I chose to pay for courses on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) prior to pursuing higher education. 
Once I understood the material then I knew I was ready to work towards the degree and certifications.
This was a necessary path for me understanding the industries that I wanted to work in required a combination of certifications and the degree.

I chose to attend [WGU](https://www.wgu.edu/) because it provided me with certifications and the degree.
Things I required but you may not. 
You don't need a degree or certifications necessarily to get into cyber.

### Hands On

The material in this section is great for mixing things up a bit. 
Once upon a time I would watch youtube videos on hacking and mess with vulnhub.  
Then it turned to me taking udemy classes.  
I'd take a break from Udemy, and pivot over to Hackthebox or Tryhackme.

- [Tryhackme](https://www.tryhackme.com/)

- [HackTheBox - Academy](https://academy.hackthebox.com/) and my --[Referral](https://referral.hackthebox.com/mz9PNmZ)

### CTF / Competitive / Fun

Learning can be fun when you find others to compete with in **"Capture the Flag"** **(CTF)** competitions. 
This is something I do with fellow [WGU](https://www.wgu.edu/) students.

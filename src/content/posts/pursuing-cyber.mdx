So, you're interested in cyber security...

## Where to Start?

```bash
user@my-linux-distro:~#  whoami
beginner 
```

Find what industry you're interested working in and start learning! 
Opportunities may be limited depending on what it is that you want to do. 
There are many different cyber security paths you can traverse. 
If you arenâ€™t sure yet, then look at job boards and develop an understanding of the requirements for getting into particular industries.

## Resources

From here I can only suggest general learning resources to get started. 
Below are online resources that I've used. 
Your mileage may vary.

### Educational

> Do your own research before paying for anything!!!

- [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) --*I only bought courses when they were $11 USD.*

- [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/)

- [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/)

- [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/)

- [Western Governors University](https://www.wgu.edu/) --[My WGU Referral](https://infl.tv/o67J).

I chose to attend [WGU](https://www.wgu.edu/), after studying on other platforms first, because it provided me with certifications and the degree. 
You get subscriptions to [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/), [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/), 
and [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/) as a [WGU](https://www.wgu.edu/) student.  

You may be in a different situation.
Not everyone has the same requirements and you'll need to determine what those are for yourself.

### Hands On

The material in this section is great for mixing things up a bit. 
Once upon a time I would watch youtube videos on hacking and mess with vulnhub.  
Then it turned to me taking udemy classes.  
I'd take a break from Udemy, and pivot over to Hackthebox or Tryhackme.

- [Tryhackme](https://www.tryhackme.com/)

- [HackTheBox - Academy](https://academy.hackthebox.com/) and my --[Referral](https://referral.hackthebox.com/mz9PNmZ)

- [Terminus](https://web.mit.edu/mprat/Public/web/Terminus/Web/main.html)

- [OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/)

- [Vulnhub](https://www.vulnhub.com/)

- [Blue Team Labs](https://blueteamlabs.online/)

- [Immersive Labs](https://www.immersivelabs.com/)

- [PWNED Labs](https://pwnedlabs.io/)

- [TCM Security](https://tcm-sec.com/)

### CTF / Competitive

Learning can be fun when you find others to compete with in **"Capture the Flag"** **(CTF)** competitions. 
This is something I do with fellow [WGU](https://www.wgu.edu/) students.

- [picoCTF](https://picoctf.org/)

- [CTFTIME](https://ctftime.org/)

- [NCAE CYBER GAMES](https://www.ncaecybergames.org/)

- [NATIONAL CYBER LEAGUE](https://nationalcyberleague.org/)
